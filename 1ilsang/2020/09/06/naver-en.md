- Now we're done with your shoes, Eddy.
- What's next? What do you want to clean up?
- Maybe my books?
- I have so many books and magazines.
- It's unbelievable you have such a wide selection of books.
- But all of them are disorganized.
- It takes a lot of time to find the book that I'm looking for.
- Let's arrange these books the way they are organized in libraries.

- Wow, you've got so much exercise equipment at home!
- Do you work out at home instead of going to the gym?
- You know that I'm a homebody.
- I prefer working out and resting at home.
- I'm afraid it'll make a lot of noise.
- Doesn't your downstairs neighbor say anything about the noise?
- They do. So I'm thinking of moving out.
- What? Oh, no...

- Loot at this place!
- It looks like a totally new place, right?
- It does! Do you have anything to eat in the fridge?
- No, sorry. Let's go out and grab something.
- Oh, come to think of it, didn't you use to only eat gluten-free food?
- Yes, I did. But I don't anymore.

- That was one of the best meals I've ever had.

- Dave, isn't it hard to find jobs these day?
- That's true, it is not easy to find a decent job.
- Have you heard about Kyle with his new business?
- Yes, but I feel that it would be better if he'd not started a business.
- It might have been much harder than expected to manage a business.
- I guess you can't always have good outcomes.
- Yes, life is often like that.
- Let's hope he'll make good choices from now on, and things will get better.

- Do you know what happened today when I took a taxi?
- Why? Was something wrong with that taxi?
- The taxi was running with a flat tire and eventually, it stopped in the middle of the road.
- Oh my goodness! Since when did the tire start to deflate?
- I think ever since it hit something in the road.
- Wow! Did you make it home safely?
- No, I had to walk for the last mile to get home.
- Why did you walk home?
- I couldn't wait for the tire to be fixed.
- Well done. I am glad that you didn't get hut.
