- Hi, Nick. Where have you been?
- I'm coming from the doctor's because of my foot.
- Your foot? Did it bother you?
- It felt numb when I walked to the bathroom last night.
- So, I went to a doctor first thing in the morning.
- Isn't it because we walked for to long yesterday?
- Well, don't worry about it.

- Welcome to my place, Min.
- Hi, Eddy. Thank you for inviting me to your place.
- Thank you for coming to help clean up my apartment.
- (looking at Eddy's place) Wow, it's not that messy.
- Haha, you know what? All the clutter is hidden somewhere.
- So, can you help me clear out the clutter this time?
- That's what I'm here for.
- Where should we start?

- (showing his shoes in his room) First, where should I put all these shoes?
- Why did you put your dress shoes and sneakers in your room?
- I wanted to make a good impression on you.
- Actually, all of these had been in the entryway.
- Ahh... please find a big basket or get a shoe rack.
- Or we can use a decorative curtain to hide shoes.
- How about this one? Will this work?

- What have you been doing?
- I'm going to keep taking liberal arts classes this fall.
- Only liberal arts classes? No major classes?
- Yes, I want to finish my liberal arts classes before taking my major ones.
- That's a good plan! By the way, what is your major?
- I like computers so I'm majoring in cyber security.
- Oh! Is it a new area?
- That's right. Don't you think it's a little secret?
- Yeah, and it looks incredibly difficult. Awesome!
- It's challenging, but it's really fun.

- Where's Fred?
- He went with Sonya and Mike to their beach party.
- If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't be alone with that couple.
- Yep, it's a bit awkward. Two's company and three's a crowd.
- That's what I mean.
- Fred will probably regret going with them.
- That's right. Those two don't care about other people and hang out.
- Should we have prevented Fred from joining them?

- David, let me buy you a meal.
- Oh, it's ok. I'll treat you this time.
- I am getting paid tomorrow.
- Didn't you say that you have a lot to spend this month?
- Don't worry. My new job has tripled my salary.
- That's great. Then, thank you for the food.
- Should we get some desserts as well?
- Sure, what would you like for dessert?
- I prefer cheesecake or carrot cake.
- Okay, let's go for cheesecake.
