- Thank you.
- What brought you in today?

- I'm going to refer you to neurological surgery.
- Okay, thanks.
- (outside of the doctor's office) I got your personal information registered in the system.
- So, go to neurological surgery and wait for your turn.
- Thank you. Where's neurological surgery?
- It's on the 7th floor.
- Take the elevator over there.

- Please make a fist.
- You're going to feel a slight string.
- Ouch!
- Okay. Press down on that for about a minute.
- Try not to rub it.

- If you're note better after that, please come and see me again.
- Thanks. I will.

- Rogan, can you help me with washing the car?
- Sure.
- Thanks, Rogan. You are always my friend who I am grateful for.
- No worries. Can you pass me the basket, soap, towel, and some water?
- Here you go. How about going for some Thai food after we're done washing the car?
- Sounds great. But I have to warn you that I will eat a lot since I like Thai food.
- No problem. Let me buy you the food. Is that okay with you?
- Yes. I am so happy that you're buying me the food.

## 0821

- I'm sick of staying home on holidays every year.
- Do you have a place you want to travel in particular?
- Yes, I am scheduled to go see an aurora.
- Then you should travel north. I'm so jealous!
- But I'm not sure if I will be able to see an aurora.
- Why? Only if the travel schedule is long, can't you see it well enough?
- It is summer, so it's harder to see an aurora than winter.
- Then, how about going in winter instead of summer?
- I don't know if I will be able to take a time off in winter.

## 0822

- Rose, don't you think I've been gaining some weight recently?
- Well, I don't think so.
- I think I've been gaining weight since my mom gives me a lot of food lately.
- You have to eat what is enough for you.
- But, I shouldn't leave leftover from food that my mom has cooked for me.
- That's true. It is hard.
- So how can I lose weight if I have to eat all the food that my mom makes for me?
- Why don't you say that you are going to eat less food for your diet, in the first place?
- That's a good idea. Then she can save some food for later.
