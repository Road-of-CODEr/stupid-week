- Excuse me, are you going to the airport?
- Yes. My taxi is on the way.
- Then can we possibly share a taxi?
- I reserved a taxi on the app, but the driver hasn't shown up.
- How many of you?
- Just myself.
- Sure. Oh, here comes the taxi.

- (to a driver)How long will it take to get to the airport?
- I'm not sure. The traffic is terrible today.
- Why don't we get out here and take another one on the main road?
- Yes. We'd better do that.
- (after getting out of the taxi) Aww, wait... should we walk all the way back?
- I'm afraid so.
- Please wait. I need to change from there flip-flops to sneakers.

- Whew... I'm tired. In a pleasant way.
- Yes, it was good to walk with good company.
- Would you like some water, Miranda?
- Yes, thank you. I'm always thirsty after a long walk.
- And drink some coffee, too, if you want.
- Thanks, but I try not to drink coffee after 6.
- Late-night coffee makes it hard for me to fall asleep.

## 0813

- Is this Lucy?
- Yes, this is Lucy. Who am I speaking to?
- This is your friend, Jack!
- Oh, Jack, sorry, I didn't know your number had been changed. I will save this number.
- That's okay. Are you available for lunch today?
- Not really, I must finish cleaning today.
- Ok, how about later in the week?
- Sure, that'll be fine.
- Got it. You just need to get my call in time!

- Miss Sophia, did you call me this morning?
- Yes, do you want to get dinner with me?
- Oh, I'm very sorry that I missed your call. Dinner sounds great!
- What day do you prefer this week?
- How about Thursday or Friday?
- I am so sorry, I have some appointments on those days.
- Oh no, those are my only available days.
- Hmm, we seem to be very busy people.
- Then let's try again next week, okay?
- Yes, I am fine with that.

## 0815

- I don't have much appetite today.
- Why? It's almost dinner time.
- I had some snacks this afternoon.
- Didn't you have enough lunch?
- I was busy doing work, and it got late, so I had a rough meal.
- I see. But it's not bad to have a light dinner.
- That's right. I might eat dinner lightly as well today.
- Then why don't we simply eat some cereal for dinner?
