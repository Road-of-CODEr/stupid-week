## Days of Small Challenges

Recently, I'm constantly challenging something. It's not much, but I'm trying to do.

For example, I studied English during rush hour, participate in algorithm competitions every week and to exercise steadily.

It was quite difficult to study privately while working at a company. So, I tried not to lose my consistency at home.

I decided to keep my goal every week with my friends. The first attemps is this repo. I will share and organize my goals every week. It will be fun!

I'm not good enough now, but I'm sure I'll do well. Through this, I will prepare to write a wonderful memoir at the end of the year.

Thanks.
