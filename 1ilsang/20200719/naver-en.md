- Did you have dinner already even though it is only 5 o'clock?
- I did have lunch at noon, but I didn't think it was enough.
- What did you eat for lunch?
- I had an Indian curry.
- But the food was too spicy, so I couldn't eat a lot.
- So I ate Mexican food, a Tostada, around 4 o'clock since I got hungry.
- You made a good choice.
- Next time, I will recommend you some Korean food that isn't too spicy.
