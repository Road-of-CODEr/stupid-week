## Let's look back on the week and make plans for next week.

This week, I met many friends.

First, I had a housewarming for my cloub friend. My friend's house had a very strong impact. First of all the interior was very well decorated. Totally touching! I don't decorate my house very well, but looking at my friend's house, I felt that it was really important to take care of it well. The feelings felt in the same space were so different.

On Thursday, I met the developers with the introduction of a brother I knew. It was so much fun talking to developers my age. It was our first meeting. The conversation went really well and if we had a chance, we would like to continue our relationship with them.

Lastly, I spent the weekend with my friends in Suwon. Everyone felt that they were becoming adults. WT..?

I want to be a good friend to my friends.

These days, I'm examining a book called "Do it Python Algorithm". I didin't know Python, So I didn't go as far as I thought.

Next week, I will study harder than this week.

Thanks!
