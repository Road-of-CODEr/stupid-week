- Actually, the AC in my room isn't working.
- Oh, we're sorry. Let me go up and check.
- (in the room) Do you think you can fix it?
- I'm afraid not. I need to call a technician.
- Do you mind moving to a different room?
- Sure. To which one?

- We upgraded you to a superior room.
- Do you like your new room?
- Yes, thanks.

- Nice. Coffee always wakes me right up.

- What's for dinner? I'd really like a pizza.
- Didn't you have pizza for lunch?
- Yes, but I really want a combination pizza again.
- Please eat a variety of things.
- Then what should I eat?
- I suggest a salad. What kind of salads do you like?
- I am not really a big fan of salads.
- You need to eat variously. How about some soup, then?
- I only eat mushroom soup among all the soups.
- Ok, I'll make you some mushroom soup.

- What's there to eat? I want a sandwich.
- I will look for the ingredients in the refrigerator.
- I think we have the ingredients for the sandwich.
- I like a sandwich that contains bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes.
- Okay, but i am afraid that we won't have enough mayonnaise and pickles.
- I think it will be fine without those two ingredients.
- Sounds good. Then I will make two, one for you and one for me.
- I will make the chips that will go with the sandwiches.

## 0808

- I'm getting hungry. How about you?
- I am not really hungry now. My appetite is low today.
- Then, why don't we get dinner after an hour during the news hour?
- That would be better.
- Ok, I'll wait. I would rather get some snacks now.
- You should eat healthy snacks like yogurt, berries, or nuts.
- However, my preference is for ice cream or chips.
- Is that healthy?
- I don't think so, compared to the snacks that you just recommended.
- You should get some healthy nuts for a snack from now on.
