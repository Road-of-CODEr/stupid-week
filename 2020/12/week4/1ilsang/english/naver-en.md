- As far as I remember, your car broke down several times this year. Don't you want to get a new car?
- I'd love to, but my wife wants to save money.
- That sounds like she's frugal.
- Sometimes I can't understand her. We've already set some money aside for things like this. What's the point of living if we don't enjoy our lives?

- Don't you need a car to go our driving on the weekend?
- I don't like driving for pleasure. I commute to and from work for more than 3 hours every day, so...
- How about your wife? Does she drive?
- Yes, but honestly, she's very aggressive when driving. I don't feel comfortable when she drives with us in the car.
- Then it can be a good excuse to stay home, I guess.

- Yoon, I have to fly to Frankfurt tonight.
- What for? Is there something urgent to take care of?
- I think so. Jake has been working on the deal with a German client. And he called to ask me to go over there ASAP. If anything comes up here, let me know, okay?
- Got it. Good luck.
- And please pass this document along to Somi.

- Did you go on a trip during the winter vacation?
- It seems most of your friends went on a trip and came back.
- No, I didn't. Whenever my friends brag about it, I get so jealous.
- Why didn't you go? Didn't you have enough money?
- No, my parents wouldn't let me.
- I totally screwed up my last exam.
- Wait, that's why? They're so strict!
- That's right. But I didn't have any reason to persuade my parents.
- Yeah, you totally screwed up the las exam.
- Yes, it's true. I admit it.

- You'll never believe what my nine-year-old nephew asked me today.
- What did he ask?
- He asked me, "When can I learn to drive a car?"
- Does he want to drive already?
- Yes. He wants to drive his toy car.
- So, did you teach him?
- No, but instead I teased him that he couldn't get on his car without a driver's license.
- And what did you nephew reply?
- He said that he will make a wish to Santa to get a driver's license.
- Isn't he so cute?

- Did you see the documentary that aired yesterday?
- No, I didn't see it. Why do you ask?
- I watched it by chance while switching channels, and it was so fun.
- I have never seen it before, but I heard about it.
- I heard it is about a famous detective.
- Yeah. He got to the bottom of a series of unsolved cases.
- Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
- Wow, I've got to see that.
- I really like mystery shows.
